# astro-stacker
A simple astrophotography image stacking tool written in python.


## TODO:
    - Add logic to select optimal star match pair for offset calculkation.
    - Image transform validation. Discard images transformed incorrectly (check if ref and light are aligned).

    - Blob detection algorithm could be improved to  work with all odd shapes. Some u shapes cause missidentifications.
    - Introduce 12, 14, or 32 bit processing
